# Assignments to prep for Module 2

## HTML/CSS

**REQUIRED**

* Unless you have **significant** experience with HTML and CSS, choose one of these to complete:

  1) [Shay Howe's Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). Written tutorial. Super informative and comprehensive. Not obnoxious. Lots of hours.

  2) [Khanacademy's HTML/CSS: Making Webpages](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css). Video and in-browser editor. Super informative, slightly obnoxious at points :) Approximately 3-6 hours.

* Build a personal blog site. There are three options for this project:

  1) MILD: Build a personal site with a blog portion using plain HTML and CSS. At minimum, your site should contain an `index.html`, `styles.css`, and a first blog post: `insert-first-post-title-here.html`. 

  2) MEDIUM: Clone [this Jekyll starter repo](). Remove the `.git` folder (`rm -rf .git`) and rename the repository `yourgithubusername.github.io`. Check out the README for instructions on how to view your site. Push your project to Github Pages using [these instructions](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/jekyll-blog-github-pages/pushing-project-to-gh-pages.markdown). 
  
  3) SPICY: Use the [Jekyll Docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to set up your own blog. Push your project to Github Pages using [these instructions](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/jekyll-blog-github-pages/pushing-project-to-gh-pages.markdown).
