# Module 2 Prep Work


## Solidifying & Building on Mod 1 Concepts

Please take some to review some of the topics in this [Data Types](https://frontend.turing.io/lessons/module-2/data-types-in-js.html) lesson.  It reviews not only the data types you've explored but also gets more into dynamic vs static typed languages, type coercion, and why we're able to call methods or access properties on primitive data types (`'yolo'.toUpperCase()`).

Also, please make a fresh copy of [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUc38HU5JCr4-b7bg8XiYqEXgg6jZ4-qKRQLGNrXBtc/edit) that you can edit.  This document contains some reading material and practice exercises that will help you solidify important concepts from Mod 1. Some information might be new to you, some might be review.

You should read through this document and fill out any practice exercises or question prompts in the copy that you've created. If you are unsure of any of your answers, take note of it. You should have this completed (along with any notes) to bring with you on Day 1 of Mod 2.

## ES6 & Evolution of JavaScript

As the web becomes more advanced, the JavaScript language evolves and gains more features to support more complex browser capabilities. This is how we get newer versions of the language. In the current developer ecosystem, you'll hear people talking about ES5, ES6 and ES7 (E is for [ECMAScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/912479/what-is-the-difference-between-javascript-and-ecmascript).

In Mod 1, you mostly learned JavaScript syntax that was introduced with the ES5 version. This version is widely supported by modern browsers, and includes things like your standard `var` and `function` declarations. Browser developers are still working on supporting newer versions like ES6 and ES7.

You may have come across some ES6 syntax throughout your independent study (including variable declarations like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and even Classes). In Mod 2, we'll expect you to begin using ES6 features and syntax where appropriate. Read more about the following ES6 features from [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read):

- From [Chapter 1: Block Bindings](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-block-bindings), read:
  * the entire chapter
- From [Chapter 3: Functions](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-functions), read:
  * Functions with Default Parameter Values
  * Arrow Functions

## User Interface & User Experience (UI/UX)

Its important to consider how users will be interacting with our applications. Review this [Intro to UI/UX lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-2/intro-ui-ux-empathy-in-design.html). In M2 we will be learning about the user experience in terms of accessibility. This will give you a great introduction in thinking about your future users. 

------------------------------------------------------

## Debugging

While you may have seen and used the browser's Developer Tools in module 1, we'd like you to step through this Udemy course on [Dev Tools](https://www.udemy.com/devtools-2017-the-basics-of-chrome-developer-tools/). Some of it may be review, but you may pick up some new tricks along the way!

------------------------------------------------------
## Array Prototype Methods: Iterators  
  
Iterator methods are one of the key concepts of M2. If you find some extra time, make sure to read the [array prototype iterators lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-2/array-prototype-methods-iterators.html). Many students have found [this TreeHouse course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-array-iteration-methods) to be helpful in their preparation for M2.
------------------------------------------------------

## Professional Development

The job hunt is getting closer! You will be expected to create a resume in Mod 2. Many students find it difficult to balance creating a resume with completing project work. It is recommended that you write a first draft your resume over intermission to lessen the load down the line. Start by pre-reading [this PD lesson](https://careerdev.turing.edu/module_two/mod2_week1) and then begin a draft of your resume.

## Refactor Mod 1 Projects

  - *DRY up your code*
    - Find areas where code is duplicated and break it out into a function
  - *Change for loops into `forEach`*
    - You'll be working with a lot of Array iterator methods in Mod 2 like [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach), start practicing them now!
    - Focus on: `forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `find`, `sort`, and `reduce`
  - *Try out converting some ES5 syntax to ES6*
    - You can refactor and your projects they should still work in Google Chrome
