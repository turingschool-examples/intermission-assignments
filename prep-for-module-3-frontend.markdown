# Mod 3 Pre-Work

## Instructional Pre-Work for Mod 3

### Libraries and Frameworks

* What is a JavaScript framework? [Watch this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXA1zpv4DhA)
* Why would we want to use a framework? [Read this article.](https://medium.com/dailyjs/the-deepest-reason-why-modern-javascript-frameworks-exist-933b86ebc445)

There are a bunch of JavaScript frameworks out there to use. At Turing, we choose to teach **React** - it's one of the most popular frameworks out there. Actually, a lot of developers will call React a library, which it is...but it can also be described as a framework. It's a little confusing, but the lines are blurred for React. Let's just say that React is a library with some rules and conventions to follow.

Complete **one** of the tutorials below to get introduced to React:
* [Tyler McGinnis's React Tutorial: A Comprehensive Guide to learning React.js in 2018](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/)
* [React tutorial from the docs](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [Scrimba React Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact)
* Optional: practice building a simple app in React. Think of a mod 1 project, and build that in React! We strongly encourage you to spin up a React app with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and play around with it!

### Testing paradigms

We are going to learn a new type of testing! In Mods 1 and 2, you learned about unit testing (testing a single function or class) and integration testing (testing multiple functions/classes working together). In Mod 3, we are going to explore "end-to-end" (sometimes called E2E) testing!

* Read [this blog post](https://www.guru99.com/end-to-end-testing.html) for a high level overview of E2E
* Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/Fw98L-kcRpc) to learn about "user stories" in agile workflows - this will help us figure out how to write our E2E tests!
* Practice writing user stories by creating some user stories for a Mod 2 or Mod 1 project

### Destructuring
Destructuring is a helpful "shortcut" in JavaScript, and it's common to see it in React Code. While you'll never be *required* to use destructuring, you should definitely be able to work with it and understand how it works.   
* Walk through [this lesson](https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-2/intro-to-destructuring.html)

### Workflow

Workflow is something you will deal with every day on the job. Let's continue strengthening our knowledge of workflow skills with these articles.

* Review [The Difference Between Forking and Cloning a Repository](https://github.community/t5/Support-Series/The-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/ba-p/1372)
* Review [Updating a Remote's URL](https://help.github.com/en/articles/changing-a-remotes-url)

### Tooling 

* Install the [React Dev Tools.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)

You'll need to make sure you've got the Xcode Command Line Tools before the mod starts. The CLT are necessary for many of React's dependencies to work as expected. 

```bash
# to see whether you have the CLT, run:
xcode-select -v

# If you don't have the CLT, run:
xcode-select --install

```

## Deliverables 

### 1. React Review *(required)*
Create a GitHub gist to answer these questions in as much detail as possible. Imagine someone is asking these questions in an interview (these are popular interview questions).

* What is a "data model", and how does it relate to the DOM in a front-end application?
* What is a "framework?" And how does it differ from a "library?"
* Why should we consider using a framework over vanilla JS like you have been doing in mods 1 and 2?
* What is a "component" in React? Why is it useful to have components?
* What is JSX?
* What are React "props?"
* What is React "state?"
* What does "data down, actions up" mean in React?

_Note:_ As you do your research, stay away from React articles that talk exclusively about "hooks". We _will_ be learning hooks in Mod 3 but they are not a requirement for success in the module.

**By 5PM on Friday of intermission, send a link to your gist in a DM to _both_ of your instructors.**

### 2. LinkedIn Updates *(required)*
Please update your LinkedIn profiles with...  
* additional skills that you’ve learned since Mod 1
* ensure you have technical keywords in your About Me professional story
* take “student” out of your headline if it’s there 
* any other updates needed to get your LinkedIn optimized for your job search  

[Here’s a refresher on our guidelines for effective LinkedIn profiles.](https://careerdev.turing.edu/resources/branding_resources) The Career Dev team will be requesting a re-submission of your LinkedIn on Friday of Week 2, and we recommend using intermission to work on this.

## Extra Resources

Here are some additional resources:

- Take a deeper dive into JSX with the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) and this [tutorial](https://flaviocopes.com/jsx/)
